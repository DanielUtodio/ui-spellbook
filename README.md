# UI Spellbook

This repository is my personal UI learning lab.

It contains isolated UI patterns ("spells") that I study, build, and revisit
to understand how modern user interfaces work.

## Purpose
- Break down intimidating UI patterns into simple, isolated demos
- Build recognition of common UI techniques
- Serve as a long-term reference for frontend development

## Structure
Each top-level folder groups UI patterns by category
(e.g. layout, forms, motion, shapes).

Some folders will contain:
- Plain HTML/CSS demos
- Isolated React (Vite) demos
- Small README files explaining each UI pattern

This repository will grow gradually over time.
